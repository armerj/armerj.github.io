I served in the Airforce for fours and half years, and am now in the Air National Guard. I graduated from University of Washington - Tacoma Dec 2016 with my Masters in Computer Science. 

I started writing these posts to help me learn to get things down on paper. Its one thing to do the work and its completely different to write down what was done. This has already helped me to slow down and explain things better than I had before.
