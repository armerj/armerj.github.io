title: What Is So Special About the MC81F4204
---

I became interested in ABOV's MC81F4204 when I started doing research into Pixmob's bracelets. Pixmob is a company that makes bracelets for entertainment events such as concerts. The bracelets allow the crowd to become part of the show as the bracelet flash in time with the beat or light up to display patterns in the crowd. At a Taylor Swift concert the bracelets were used to paint crowns in the crowd or to show a snake moving across the crowd.

Pixmob makes two types of bracelets, one using bluetooth and the other using IR to receive commands. The IR version is made for bigger crowds and allow better control over the patterns that can be displayed. Pixmob has created a Android and IPhone app for the bluetooth model; allowing the event attendees to use the bracelet outside of the event. Unfortunately, there is no such app for the IR version. 

<link and name> has reverse engineered the phone app to learn bracelet commands and how they are passed over bluetooth. Others have attempted to brute force the IR commands to control the IR versions. Jg? has done extensive research into repurposing the bracelets by flashing the MC81F4204 that controls the bracelet with custom code. During his research he has created an ISP ***ISP meaning*** programmer to reprogram the MC81F4204.

I decided to use this microcontroller to learn more about hardware, assembly code and radare2. I had the following goals when I started this project.<br>
- Learn how to read microcontroller documentation<br>
- Learn how the microcontroller functioned at a low level<br>
- Create a radare2 plugin<br>
- Attempt to dump firmware from the microcontroller<br>
